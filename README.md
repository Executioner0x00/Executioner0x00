## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**NS6089-tech/NS6089-tech** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my GDI malware comeback
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with no one
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about MY SUPERHERO MOVIE ğŸ”¥
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Nope
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: It would be so awesome
It would be so cool
It would be the most incredible superhero
Movie the world has ever seen
The screens would light up
With real explosions and special effects
Like tons and tons of special effects
My super sweet cape would be special effects
And it would blow your mind
'Cause it's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
It's all about me, yeah, it's all about me
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
They'll be lining up to see a movie all about me
No longer a sidekick, no, that's not me
Picture my booty up in 3D
I'll shake my booty in my own movie
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
They'll be lining up to see a movie all about me
I'd have the most impressive, cool and scary
Big, mean, hairy adversary
But not to worry, I'm the man in charge
Yeah, I'd have an alter ego
I'd be a billionaire
Standing tall with adult-sized hands
And gorgeous hair (gorgeous hair)
'Cause it's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
It's all about me, yeah, it's all about me
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
They'll be lining up to see a movie all about me
No longer the sidekick (sidekicks are lame!)
Now I'm the superhero putting villains to shame
R-O-B-I-N is the name!
Ooh, and I'd have my own hero music, too
It'd go bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, boom!
It would play every time that I entered a room
Then I'd say my sweet and ominous catchphrase
"Crack an egg on it, ca-caw!"
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
It's all about me, yeah, it's all about me
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
They'll be lining up to see a movie all about me
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
It's all about me (it's all about me), it's all about me
(It's my movie, my movie) my movie, my superhero movie
(Lining up to see, all about me) yeah, it's all about me
